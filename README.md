# Triple Diffie-Hellman (3-DH) Protocol Simulation

This project is part of the practical coursework for the **Network Security course** in the Masterâ€™s program in
**Engineering and Computer Science** at the **University of Verona**.

This project simulates communication between a Python Client and Server that use the **Triple Diffie-Hellman (3-DH)**
protocol to securely establish a shared key.

### How the Protocol works

The 3-DH Protocol works as follows:

1. **Each Party Generates Key Pairs**:
    - Both the client and server generate a long-term Diffie-Hellman key pair and an ephemeral key pair.
2. **Exchange of Public Keys**:
    - The client and server exchange their long-term and ephemeral public keys.
3. **Calculation of Shared Secrets**:
    - Using the exchanged public keys and their own private keys, both the client and server compute three shared
      secrets.
4. **Derivation of the Final Shared Key**:
    - The three shared secrets are combined (often using a hash function) to derive the final shared key, which is used
      for secure communication.

## Project Structure

- **client.py**: Python script that acts as the client, connects to the server to establish a shared key using the
  Triple Diffie-Hellman (3-DH) protocol, and sends an encrypted message.
- **server.py**: Python script that acts as the server, accepts the client connection, calculates the shared key, and
  decrypts the received message.
- **functions.py** (optional): Python module with auxiliary functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption.

## Running the Project

1. Open two terminals in the project folder.
2. Run the server with the command: `python3 server.py`. The server will generate the necessary parameters for the Triple Diffie-Hellman protocol and start listening for
   connections on port 12345.
3. Run the client with the command: `python3 client.py`. The client will connect to the server, receive the generated
   parameters, and calculate the shared key.
4. The client will send an encrypted message to the server, which will decrypt and display it.

## Requirements

- `cryptography` library for encryption.

## Note on Security

This implementation is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate how the Triple Diffie-Hellman protocol
works. _**It is not intended for production use**_. For secure communication, it is
recommended to use established cryptographic libraries and protocols.
